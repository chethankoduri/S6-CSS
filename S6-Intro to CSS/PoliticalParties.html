          The committee has a long history of political influence in the united Andhra Pradesh state, 
          however, it has faced challenges in recent years, including a decline in electoral support, 
          particularly after the formation of Telangana as a separate state in 2014.

    <img src="./Images/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi_Logo.jpg"/>
    <p>The Bharat Rashtra Samithi, formerly known as Telangana Rashtra Samithi, is an Indian political party which is predominantly active in the state of Telangana and currently the primary opposition party in the state. 
        It was founded on 27 April 2001 by K. Chandrashekar Rao, with a single-point agenda of creating a separate Telangana state with Hyderabad as its capital.[14] It has been instrumental in carrying forth a sustained agitation for the granting of statehood to Telangana.
        In the 2014 Telangana Assembly Election, the party won a majority of seats and formed the first government of the State with K. Chandrashekar Rao as its chief minister.
         In the 2014 general election the party won 11 seats, making it the eighth largest party in Lok Sabha, 
         the lower house (lok sabha) of the Indian Parliament.
         After a landslide victory in 2018 Telangana Legislative Assembly election, the party formed the government in the State for the second time.
          In the 2019 Indian general election, the party's tally had fallen to nine seats in the Lok Sabha.
           As of February 2023, the party holds seven seats in upper house of Rajya Sabha.
        Later on 5 October 2022, the name of the party was changed from Telangana Rashtra Samithi to Bharat Rashtra Samithi to foray into the national politics.
         After suffering a decisive defeat in the 2023 Telangana Legislative Assembly election, 
         the party was restricted to winning only 39 seats in the state of Telangana.</p>

    <P>The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen is an Indian political party based primarily in the old city of Hyderabad,
         It is also a significant political party in the Indian States of Telangana, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, 
         Tamil Nadu and Bihar.
         AIMIM has held the Lok Sabha seat for the Hyderabad constituency since 1984. 
        In the 2014 Telangana Legislative Assembly elections, the party won seven seats and received recognition
         as a "state party" by the Election Commission of India.
        For much of its existence, it had little presence beyond old Hyderabad. 
        However, in more recent years, it has begun expanding into other states. 
        It now has a significant presence in Maharashtra, with Imtiyaz Jaleel winning the Aurangabad Lok Sabha constituency in 2019 and with multiple members elected to the Legislative Assembly.
         It has also made inroads in Bihar, winning five Legislative Assembly seats in 2020.
        Multiple members of the party have been accused of inciting violence, fear mongering and hate speech</P>
